# About the dataset:
## What is this: 
Data on 4.168 artists from Vagalume.com, with:Styles/Popularity/Number of songs


The dataset I used was obtained by the author：Anderson Neisse (Owner) using R to crawl the Brazilian website "vagalume", which contains the name of the artist, the corresponding genre, the number of songs owned, and the popularity.

## Questions I want to explore:
1. What are the most popular singers and their corresponding genres?
2. Is there a correlation between an artist's genre and his or her popularity?
